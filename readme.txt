CONTRIBUTION OF TEAM MEMBERS
1.ANUSHRUTI SINGH- implementation of input file by using command line arguments and code.
2.K.K.PAVITHRA- given code for converting graph into adjacency matrix and execution of program on linux. 
3.KAVITA CHAUDHARY- given code for dijkstra algorithm and made the reports.


INSTRUCTION 
OPEN THE PROGRAM compile : gcc sssp.c -o ssp\n
run : ./sssp <Path to file> <Node Name> \n
sssp.c is the file name.
make sure path to the file is correct


EXAMPLES
1-/sssp /home/neha/newfile.txt 1
Graph is : 
 3 6 0 1 0 
0 4 5 2 2 
0 0 1 0 0 
0 0 0 5 1 
0 0 5 0 2 

Distance of 1 = 6
Path = 1 <-0
Distance of 2 = 7
Path = 2 <-4 <-3 <-0
Distance of 3 = 1
Path = 3 <-0
Distance of 4 = 2
Path = 4 <-3 <-0


CHALLENGES FACED
1- To take the input from the file using command line argumrents.
2- We faced challenge while converting file input to adjacency matrix.
3- Program crashing while taking input from the file.
4- In implementiing dijkstra algorithm by taking vertex cost.


HOW DID WE OVERCOME
1. We inculcated commandline arguments from google.
2. Googled file handling functions to implement file.  
2. To accomplish the program we took help from website.



WHAT DID WE LEARNT FROM THE ASSIGNMENT
1. We learned how to take input from the file by using command line arguments.
2. We learned file handling functions.
3. How to represent graph in C.
4. Implementation of Dijkstra algorithm.
